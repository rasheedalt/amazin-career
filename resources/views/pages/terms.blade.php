<h3>Terms of Services</h3>
            <div class="post">
                <p><strong>Revised: August 1, 2020</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
                <p>By creating an account or otherwise using the Services (as defined below) in any manner, you are entering into a legally binding agreement with AmazinCareers, as set forth in these Terms of Use (“Terms”). These Terms also include our Privacy Policy which is incorporated by reference.</p>

                <p>You must be at least 16 years of age to use the Services. If you are under 16 years of age, you may not, under any circumstances or for any reason, use the Services. The Services are not targeted to or meant for anyone who has not reached 16 years of age and we will not knowingly collect information from anyone under the age of 16. If the applicable law in the country or state in which you are using the Services requires that you be older than 16 to use the Services, then you must be at least the minimum age legally defined for such country or state in order to use the Services.</p>

                <p><strong>Services.</strong></p>
                <p>The “Services” collectively include the “Website” (meaning www.amazincareersng.com and including all webpages, subdomains, and any successor or affiliated websites), emails, newsletters, and other communications, user accounts, job application services, Coach Connect Services, Content, any other products or services offered by AmazinCareers, and any other services that state they are governed by these Terms. “Content” means any and all text, articles, images, videos, graphics, software, music, audio, information, or other materials appearing on the Website, including, without limitation, information about employers, career resources, advice, questions, answers, or other content, whether created or posted by you, AmazinCareers, a third party, or any other user.</p>

                <p><strong>Modifications..</strong></p>
                <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will give you notice of the changes by posting an updated version of these Terms online, updating the “Revised” date above, or by emailing you at an email address you have provided. Changes to these Terms will be effective as of the date we post them or otherwise notify you of them, unless we specify a different effective date when we make a particular change. Your continued use of the Services will constitute your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree to a change, you must stop using the Services.
                </p>
                <p>We may modify, add to, suspend, or discontinue the Services or certain features of the Services, or remove any Content at any time for any reason, without prior notice to you. Unless expressly stated otherwise, any new feature that augments, enhances, or otherwise modifies the Services is subject to these Terms.</p>

                <p><strong>Job Applications.</strong></p>
                
                <p>The<strong>AmazinCareers</strong>  allows you to get an inside look at employers, browse open positions, and apply to jobs. Other job postings on our Website will re-direct you to the applicable employer’s career page, where you will be able to submit an application. 
                </p>

                <p><strong>Paid Services.</strong></p>
                <p>The Services include a variety of products and services that are free to use (“Free Services”), as well as certain products and services that require payment (“Paid Services”). We reserve the right to charge for Free Services or change the price for Paid Services, at any time. If you purchase any of our Paid Services, you agree to pay us any applicable fees and taxes and you agree to any additional terms that may apply. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts either directly by AmazinCareers or indirectly via a third-party payment processor. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of the applicable Paid Service. If you are directed to a third-party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing the use of that third-party’s service and that third-party’s personal information collection practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p>
                <p>These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy, and any other legal notices published on the Website, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and AmazinCareers concerning your use of the Services. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by AmazinCareers at any time without restriction. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect. If two or more provisions of this Agreement are deemed to conflict with each other’s operation, AmazinCareers shall have the sole right to elect which provision remains in force. No waiver of any one provision set forth in these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision, and AmazinCareers's failure to assert or enforce any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
